    "# Starbucks Capstone Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. This data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. As an example, a BOGO offer might be valid for only 5 days. You'll see in the data set that informational offers have a validity period even though these ads are merely providing information about a product; for example, if an informational offer has 7 days of validity, you can assume the customer is feeling the influence of the offer for 7 days after receiving the advertisement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be given transactional data showing user purchases made on the app including the timestamp of purchase and the amount of money spent on a purchase. This transactional data also has a record for each offer that a user receives as well as a record for when a user actually views the offer. There are also records for when a user completes an offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind as well that someone using the app might make a purchase through the app without having received an offer or seen an offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example, a user could receive a discount offer buy 10 dollars get 2 off on Monday. The offer is valid for 10 days from receipt. If the customer accumulates at least 10 dollars in purchases during the validity period, the customer completes the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a few things to watch out for in this data set. Customers do not opt into the offers that they receive; in other words, a user can receive an offer, never actually view the offer, and still complete the offer. For example, a user might receive the \"buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer\", but the user never opens the offer during the 10 day validity period. The customer spends 15 dollars during those ten days. There will be an offer completion record in the data set; however, the customer was not influenced by the offer because the customer never viewed the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes data cleaning especially important and tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also want to take into account that some demographic groups will make purchases even if they don't receive an offer. From a business perspective, if a customer is going to make a 10 dollar purchase without an offer anyway, you wouldn't want to send a buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer. You'll want to try to assess what a certain demographic group will buy when not receiving any offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is a capstone project, you are free to analyze the data any way you see fit. For example, you could build a machine learning model that predicts how much someone will spend based on demographics and offer type. Or you could build a model that predicts whether or not someone will respond to an offer. Or, you don't need to build a machine learning model at all. You could develop a set of heuristics that determine what offer you should send to each customer (i.e., 75 percent of women customers who were 35 years old responded to offer A vs 40 percent from the same demographic to offer B, so send offer A)."

    "# Data Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is contained in three files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)\n",
    "* profile.json - demographic data for each customer\n",
    "* transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the schema and explanation of each variable in the files:\n",
    "\n",
    "**portfolio.json**\n",
    "* id (string) - offer id\n",
    "* offer_type (string) - type of offer ie BOGO, discount, informational\n",
    "* difficulty (int) - minimum required spend to complete an offer\n",
    "* reward (int) - reward given for completing an offer\n",
    "* duration (int) - time for offer to be open, in days\n",
    "* channels (list of strings)\n",
    "\n",
    "**profile.json**\n",
    "* age (int) - age of the customer \n",
    "* became_member_on (int) - date when customer created an app account\n",
    "* gender (str) - gender of the customer (note some entries contain 'O' for other rather than M or F)\n",
    "* id (str) - customer id\n",
    "* income (float) - customer's income\n",
    "\n",
    "**transcript.json**\n",
    "* event (str) - record description (ie transaction, offer received, offer viewed, etc.)\n",
    "* person (str) - customer id\n",
    "* time (int) - time in hours since start of test. The data begins at time t=0\n",
    "* value - (dict of strings) - either an offer id or transaction amount depending on the record\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you are using the workspace, you will need to go to the terminal and run the command `conda update pandas` before reading in the files. This is because the version of pandas in the workspace cannot read in the transcript.json file correctly, but the newest version of pandas can. You can access the termnal from the orange icon in the top left of this notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see how to access the terminal and how the install works using the two images below.  First you need to access the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pic1.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you will want to run the above command:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pic2.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when you enter back into the notebook (use the jupyter icon again), you should be able to run the below cell without any errors."

    "# INTRODUCTION\n",
    "The users are provided with offers every day- especially from brands they use or those whose membership they signed up for. These offers are of different types- a regular discount offer, buy X get Y, referral offers, etc. Additionally, their mode of delivery varies- it could be via emails, social media, TV advertisements, OTT ads, pop-up ads on some websites, etc. Some users love getting offers and actually fulfill those to get the rewards. Some are only irritated by these and never completely participate in these offers. A business needs to analyze these trends for better customer acquisition and retention.<br><br>\n",
    "In collaboration with the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program, Starbucks has provided data for the various offers rolled out to the users of the Starbucks rewards mobile app over time through various channels. The data contains information about offers, users, and the events such as offers received, viewed, or completed.<br><br>\n",
    "Our job is to analyze these three data sets and figure out the patterns that would improve the offer success rates, i.e., figuring out which type of users would be better for which types of offers. In other words, customer segmentation- here, this means grouping customers according to the type of offers.<br><br>\n",
    "I decided to take it a step further and tried to fit the data into a classification model that would predict if a particular type of offer with its given attributes would be successful for a given user."

    "1. Divide the channels list into individual columns of 1 or 0. For this we need to first get the unique channels.\n",
    "2. Map the offer id (the id field) from hashed value to a sequence value starting from 1. Maintain this map using a dictionary, as this will be a universal mapping of offer id for all data sets.\n",
    "3. Get the dummy variables of offer_type\n",
    "4. Convert the duration from days to hours, as the timeline of offers in transcript dataset is given in hours."

The decrement of lower value of first bin is done so people with lowest age will fall into the 1st group (instead of 0th group). Then, we will plot the graph of what was the success rate of each offer type (BOGO, Discount, and Informational offers) - in terms of how many offers of that type were successful out of those that were rolled out."

This could be because the BOGO offers are the hardest to complete, since to claim the rewards of BOGO offer, the user has to make one big transaction, whereas benefits of discount offer can be collected with multiple smaller transactions.\n",

To arrange the data, we would need to first put mapped user ids in the ```profile``` table and merge it with ```merged``` table. There are 3 categories for gender- Male, Female, and all those who does not identify as either male or female, Others. As seen from previous analysis, highest number of users identify as males, and least number of users identify as others."

    "## CONCLUSION:\n",
    "This project aims at analyzing the customers’ reception to the offers rolled out by Starbucks through their mobile app. We probed through the provided data sets and deduced the patterns that would help Starbucks in improving its ad-targeting.<br><br>\n",
    "We were able to unearth the following insights from the data:<br>\n",
    "1. More number of BOGO and discount offers were rolled out than informational offers.<br>\n",
    "2. Majority of the offers that were viewed were completed. There were around 1400 offers that were wasted, i.e., users completed them through their regular spending without being aware of them.<br>\n",
    "3. The offer with id=7, i.e. discount/Spend:10/Reward:2/Days:10 had the highest completion rate among all. The offer with id=5 (discount/Spend:20/Reward:5/Days:10) had the lowest completion rate. The offer with id 5 required higher spending and was more difficult to achieve.<br>\n",
    "4. Also, the most offers that were completed were informational offers. The BOGO offers were the least completed.<br>\n",
    "5. The offer with id=7, i.e., discount/Spend:10/Reward:2/Days:10 had the highest success rate amongst all 10. The offer with id=5 (discount/Spend:20/Reward:5/Days:10) had the lowest success rate.<br>\n",
    "6. Regarding users, most were males. The age group of 40–70 years had the highest users. Most of the users earn less than 80,000. There are some users with salaries reaching up to 120,000. Most of the users are members since mid-2017. Very few users have been members since 2014.<br>\n",
    "7. Correlation between offers’ success and user factors:<br>\n",
    "(i) Age-<br>\n",
    "· BOGO was less popular among the youngest age group of 17–34.6.\n",
    "· The oldest users (84.4–101 years) preferred discount offers more than BOGO and BOGO more than informational offers.<br>\n",
    "· Overall, people of all ages (except the youngest group) preferred discount offers.<br>\n",
    "(ii) Gender-<br>\n",
    "· Males preferred discount offers more than informational offers and informational offers more than BOGOs.<br>\n",
    "· Females and non-binary users preferred BOGO and Discount offers more than informational offers.<br>\n",
    "· For all offer types combined, females had higher offer success rates than men.<br>\n",
    "(iii) Income-<br>\n",
    "· People in the highest income group prefer BOGOs more than any other type of offers.<br>\n",
    "· The BOGO offer, being the most difficult, is least popular among the people in the lowest income group.<br>\n",
    "· Generally, as the income increases, success rates for BOGOs and Discount offers increases, and that for informational offer decreases. Therefore, for people with higher incomes, reward offers would be better.<br>\n",
    "(iv) Signup Date-<br>\n",
    "· Users since 2016 has the highest success rate.<br>\n",
    "· Generally, users from all the years complete discount offers more than the other 2 types of offers.<br>\n",
    "· For users who signed up in and after 2015, there is a drop in the success rates of the offers for every offer type.<br> This means users from 2015 are more likely to complete the presented offers.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### FUTURE SCOPE:<br>\n",
    "(a) Grid Search- the model can be put through GridSearchCV for various classifiers to improve the performance through validation. In the end, we could get hyperparameters that would give the best performance out of all the hyperparameters.<br>\n",
    "(b) Neural Networks- training the data on neural networks might give better prediction performance.<br>\n",
    "(c) Feature Engineering- more data can be generated from the given data. For example, PCA can be used to extract features, or features can be combined to generate polynomial features.<br>\n",
    "(d) Channels- more channels of advertising the offers can be explored and analyzed.<br><br>\n",
